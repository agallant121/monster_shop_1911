# Monster Shop
An online, e-commerce application for an easier and more convenient shopping experience.

## Background and Description

"Monster Shop" is a fictitious e-commerce platform where users can register to place items into a shopping cart and 'check out'. Users who work for a merchant can mark their items as 'fulfilled'; the last merchant to mark items in an order as 'fulfilled' will automatically set the order status to "shipped". Each user role will have access to some or all CRUD functionality for application models.

### Many-to-Many and One-to-Many Relationships
* This project utilizes both one-to-many and many-to-many relationships, connecting multiple tables in our database for an easier user experience.
